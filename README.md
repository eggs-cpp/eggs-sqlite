`Eggs.SQLite`
==============

`Eggs.SQLite` is a thin wrapper over [`SQLite`][sqlite], written following 
_Modern **C++**_ style, and makes extensive use of the _C++ Standard Library_ 
as well as the [_Boost C++ Libraries_][boost].

The library is in its early development stages, and currently provides no 
examples, tests nor documentation. Its use in a production environment is not 
recommended at the time.
